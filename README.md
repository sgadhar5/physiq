## For Physicians
✅ AI-Assisted Medical Scribing
- AI-generated smart prompts help streamline note-taking.
- Text-to-speech (TTS) transcription automatically records physician dictations and converts them into structured medical notes.
- AI learns from physician's past notes to provide structure and fill ins for easy charting.
- Physicians can check off symptoms, and AI autogenerates medical notes, reducing documentation time.
✅ Seamless EMR Integration
- AI-generated notes can be copied or exported for integration with Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems.
- Improves efficiency, allowing physicians to focus on patient care rather than documentation.
- In the future will allow seamless connection between other EMR's such as CareVue and Epic.

## For Patients
✅ AI-Powered Symptom Checker
- Patients can select symptoms from an extensive list.
- AI analyzes the selected symptoms and provides a possible diagnosis based on medical databases.
✅ Personalized Healthcare Advice
- AI generates self-care recommendations based on symptoms.
- Offers guidance on when to seek medical attention.
- Provides home remedies for minor ailments.
✅ Conversational & Intuitive UI
- Built with Streamlit, providing a simple, user-friendly interface for both physicians and patients.
